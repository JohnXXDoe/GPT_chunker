The risk assessment procedure defines a structured approach to perform risk assessment of critical . business enablers and assets and business processes of Havells. . Risk Assessment shall be performed on an annual or semi-annual basis or as and when required as per . major  organizational  changes  which  may  include  changes  in  internal/external  interested  parties, . addition/ modification of processes, assets, technical risk evaluation, and when significant changes . occur (i.e.,  adoption of new  technology, changes  in business,  introduction/ amendment in legal or . regulatory requirements or when any major information security breach is reported). The details of . various risk assessment are given in subsequent sections: . 2.1  Process Risk Assessment . Process risk assessment shall address all the risks associated with ISMS at the process level covering . key enablers such as information, business process (head office), technology, and people which are . essential  for  smooth  functioning  of  the  process. Further,  the  technology  enabler  covers  key . technology asset such as application, IT infrastructure, etc. . . This  stage  involves  listing  down  all  the  processes  specific  to  their  respective  functions. For  each . process, four kinds of impacts (Financial, Reputational, Legal & Regulatory, Operational) are:  . identified  across  five  key  risk  domains  (Confidentiality,  Data  Integrity,  Communication  Security, . Availability, Privacy) on scale of 1 to 5. . Communication . Security . Data Integrity  Availability . Data . Confidentiality . Privacy . Key . Risk . Domains . Figure 1: Key Risk . Domains .  . . .

Type . 3  Possible . 2  Unlikely . 1 - Rare . In addition, parameters like geographical location, surrounding, political, environmental factors will . be considered while deciding the likelihood of any risk. . . . 2.1.5.1  Category & Type of Control . All the applicable controls in the control database are categorized basis five identified enablers. Each . control  is  mapped  to  one  enabler  in  the  control  database. Further,  controls  are  segregated  basis . preventive, detective & corrective control types. . Post identification of the control category, controls are mapped to the applicable threats, basis the . threat vulnerabilities. . 2.1.5.2  Enabler Control Effectiveness Score . After  mapping  of  threats,  controls  &  enablers,  enabler  assessment  is  created  basis  the  applicable . threat across the domains identified for the process. For each threat likelihood is identified basis the . geographical location, surrounding, political, environmental factors etc. Further, a constant  impact . rating = 1 (for computation purpose only) is considered for each of the threats identified in the enable . assessment. . Control Rating: Control rating depicting the implementation status of the control (as per the below . table) is identified by the assessor for each control in the enabler assessment. . Control Rating  Definition . 1  Non-existent or has major deficiencies and do not operate as intended. . 2  Limited, high level of risk remains, significant deficiencies. . 3  Controls in place with few deficiencies in terms of medium risk issues. . 4  Designed and operating, with few deficiencies in terms of low risk issues. . 5  Designed and operating, with no deficiencies. . The control ratings are used to identify the revised likelihood score and revised impact score in order . to calculate the residual risk score for the corresponding threats as per the table below: .

After calculation of each residual risk score for each enabler across the process, the domain residual . base risk is computed using the below formula: . Domain Residual Base Risk = Average (Enabler Residual Risk Score)  .  . 2.1.6.1  Calculate Residual Risk Value . After calculation of domain residual base risk for each applicable domain of the process, the domain . impact score is used to calculate the domain residual risk value of each applicable domain: . Residual Risk Value = (Domain Impact * Domain Residual Base Risk) . 2.1.6.2  Risk acceptance/ Treatment/ Transfer level . The possible values of existing risk post calculation of residual risk are: . Residual Risk Score  Risk Description  Management action . 1-4  Low Risk  Accept risk - No action required . 5-10  Moderate Risk  Accept risk- Feasibility analysis  . 11 - 25  High Risk  Treat/ transfer risk . If  the  management  wants  to  accept  or  transfer  any  risk  as  per  the  results  obtained  from  the  risk . assessment, proper justification has to be provided. Risk shall be accepted for a number of reasons . including but not limited to: . a)  The potential impact is low, and cost of further protection against risk is not worthwhile in . business terms; . b)  The likelihood of an incident is low, and the cost of further protection against the risk is not . worthwhile in business terms; and . Page 12 of 20 .  . Havells India Limited . Havells India Risk Management Policy . Version 1.0 . Internal .  . . c)  The risk cannot be avoided, transferred, or mitigated any further within acceptable costs to . the businesses. . 2.1.6.3  Risk Transfer . Risk transfer involves a decision to share certain risks with external/ internal parties. Risk transfer can . create new risks or modify existing, identified risks. Therefore, additional risk assessment followed by . risk  treatment  may  be  necessary. Transfer  can  be  done  by  insurance  that  shall  support  the . consequences, or by sub-contracting a partner whose role shall be to monitor the information system . and take immediate actions to stop an attack before it makes a defined level of damage. . 2.1.6.4  Risk Treatment . Risk Treatment Plan (hereafter referred to as RTP) involves prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing . appropriate  controls  as  per  the  risk  computation. A  treatment  plan  shall  be  prepared  for  each . identified risk as per the risk assessment performed. . To  facilitate  the  implementation  of  the  risk  treatment  plan,  an  action  plan  shall  be  prepared,  and . responsibility  shall  be  assigned  for  implementing  the  recommended  controls. The  plan  shall  also . clearly highlight the expected and actual closure date of implementation. . 2.1.6.5  Closure Responsibility, Target Completion Date and Status . Details  (Name,  role,  etc.)  of  the  person  responsible  for  the  closure  of  the  risk  identified  will  be . captured along with the target date of completion for the same and the status of risk closure. . Once  recommended  controls  have  been  identified,  residual  risk  value  shall  be  computed  with  the . same approach as followed for Risk Rating to identify if the residual risk value is at acceptable level . or additional controls need to be defined to mitigating the risks. . 2.1.6.6  Management approval . It  is  the  responsibility  of  respective  department  head  to  present  risk  treatment  plan  to  the . management for approval, and regularly update on the progress of RTP. . 2.2  Site Risk Assessment . Site risk assessment shall be conducted for Havells head office. . . 2.2.1.1  Step 1 : Identify the site category  . Category of site should be identified  . 2.2.1.2  Step 2 : Perform the site Survey .

79,Policy on Preservation of Documents.pdf,"POLICY FOR PRESERVATION OF DOCUMENTS . (approvedbytheBoardofDirectorsinitsMeetingheldon9thNovember2015) .  . . Introduction . Strengthening the enforcement of compliance with listing obligations, the Securities . and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (SEBI)  notified  the  SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and . Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations,  2015  on  2nd  September,  2015. These . Regulations are an all-encompassing umbrella Listing Regulations  providing listing . conditions and disclosure requirements for various categories of securities. . . Chapter  III  of  these  Regulations,  titled  Common  Obligations  of  Listed  Entities . enumerates the general obligations of compliance which every listed entity has to . abide by. . . Specifically, Regulation 9 of the aforesaid Chapter requires a listed entity to have a . policy for preservation of documents, approved by the Board of Directors, classifying . them in atleast 2 categories as follows:-  . (a)  Documents whose preservation shall be permanent in nature . (b)  Documents with preservation period of not less than 8 (eight) years after .  . completion of the relevant transactions  . Records management is a process of ensuring the proper creation, maintenance, use . and disposal of records to achieve efficient, transparent and accountable governance. . This  helps  an  organization  to  achieve  information  accessibility,  business . enhancement and improvement. With a view to bring economy of space, efficiency . in retrieval of documents, separate departments of the organisation follow record/ . information management systems to suit their requirements. . . Nonetheless,  embracing  the  mandate  of  law  and  recognizing  the  significance  of  a . policy statement on the subject, this POLICY FOR PRESERVATION OF DOCUMENTS is . set out below: .  . . Purpose of this policy . The Company has statutory responsibilities cast upon it by various applicable laws . and regulations such as the Companies Act, 2013, the Income Tax Act, 1961, etc. to . keep accurate and sufficient records of its activities and to ensure that such records . are adequately preserved and maintained, stipulating periods of time upto how long . a record should be maintained as well as rules and guidelines for destruction. This . enables the Company comply with its statutory responsibilities under the law. . . The purpose of this policy is to broadly state the principles or desirable practices that . guide  decision  making  in  caring  for  and  preservation  of  physical  and  electronic . records/ documents to ensure that adequate records are maintained, managed and . controlled  effectively  or  disposed  of  appropriately,  commensurate  with  legal, . statutory,  operational  and  information  needs  and  in  accordance  with  relevant . legislation. . . Application of relevant provisions prescribed under various statues  . The application of this Policy, shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the rules . for  the  preservation  of  or  destruction  of  records  periods  prescribed  under  various . statutes applicable to the Company governing document preservation. Some of the . basic categories under which documents / records that can be classified are produced . below: .  . Accounts and Tax Records. Tax records include, but may not be limited to, documents . concerning  payroll,  expenses,  proof  of  deductions,  business  costs,  accounting . procedures, and other documents concerning the Company's revenues. . Employment Records/ Personnel Records. The Company should also keep personnel . files  that  reflect  performance  reviews  and  any  complaints  brought  against  the . Company  or individual employees under applicable statutes. The Company  should . also keep all final memoranda and correspondence reflecting performance reviews . and actions taken by or against personnel in the employee's personnel file. . . . . . Press Releases/ Public Filings. The Company should give special consideration while . deciding upon retention of copies of all press releases and publicly filed documents . under the theory that the Company should have its own copy to test the accuracy of . any  document  a  member  of  the  public  can  theoretically  produce  against  that . Company. . . Legal Files. Legal counsel should be consulted to determine the retention period of . particular documents. . . Marketing and Sales Documents. The Company should keep final copies of marketing . and  sales  documents  for  the  same  period  of  time  it  keeps  other  corporate  files, . generally three years. . . Intellectual Property and Trade Secrets. (e.g., patents and copyrights protected as . trade secrets). . . The  Company  should  keep  all  documents  designated  as  containing  trade  secret . information for at least the life of the trade secret. . . Contracts. Final, execution copies of all contracts entered into by the Company should . be retained. The Company should retain copies of the final contracts for at least three . years  beyond  the  life  of  the  agreement,  and  longer  in  the  case  of  publicly  filed . contracts. . . Management, Storage and Retrieval of Records . Prompt  retrieval  of  records  is  the  benchmark  of  a  good  record  and  information . management  system. Any  information/  record/  document  should  be  efficiently . retrievable by those with a legitimate right of access. . . . In  order  for  records  to  be  accessible,  it  is  important  that  records  are  created . promptly, named, referenced, or indexed appropriately, filed in a suitable location, . protected from unauthorised alteration or deleted, maintained over time. . . The record should be easily retrievable and filed in such a way that the information . can  be  promptly  destroyed  when  it  is  no  longer  needed. Referencing,  titling  and . indexing systems should be logical and easily understandable. . . Respective HoDs and senior managers of all departments/ functions are accountable . for the quality of records management within the organisation and have a duty to . make arrangements for the safe-keeping of the records of their department. . . Preservation/ Retention decisions must take into account  . -  statutory requirements . -  business needs  . -  appraisal for archival value .  . It  is  desirable  that  retention  periods,  once  agreed,  are  documented  and  applied . consistently for the same types of records across all locations of the organization, . and the same is reviewed from time to time to taking account of new legislative or . business requirements. . . Further, as a basic rule, the documents/ records should be preserved for 1 extra year . in addition to the no. of years prescribed for various document/ records preservation . by applicable statutes. . . Destruction and Maintenance of Record of documents destroyed  . From time to time respective HoDs may establish retention or destruction schedules . for  specific  categories  of  records  in  order  to  ensure  legal  compliance  and  also  to . accomplish other objectives such as cost management. . . . Upon destruction, brief particulars of the records destroyed should be documented . and certify by the relevant manager mentioning the date and mode of destruction. . . If a record relates to two or more subjects for which different retention periods have . been prescribed, it will be retained for the highest of such periods. . . While records may be reviewed and weeded out at periodical intervals in the light of . the retention periods prescribed to avoid their buildup, the attempt should be to make . a  continuous  and  conscious  effort  throughout  the  year  to  weed  out  unnecessary . records. . . Exceptions to destruction  . In the event any Company records are relevant to litigation, or potential litigation . (i.e., a dispute that could result in litigation), or in exceptional cases i.e. if the record . has certain special features or such a course is warranted by the peculiar needs of . the department then such records shall be preserved until it is determined the records . are no longer needed. . . Storage, transport and security . Appropriate and secure accommodation should be ensured for all records, wherever . they  are  stored,  processed,  transported  or  used. This  includes  providing  suitable . environmental  conditions  and  providing  appropriate  housing. Considerable . importance should be placed on the integrity of those records selected for permanent . preservation so that they remain accessible both in the present and the long term. It . also includes monitoring via pest management programme and other environmental . monitoring systems. . . Protection of sensitive records from unauthorised access . Records  can  contain  personal  and  confidential  information  which  must  not  be . disclosed to unauthorised persons. . . . Records  containing  confidential  or  sensitive  information  must  be  secured  against . unauthorised access. Confidential records in manual format must be held securely in . locked secure cabinets or stores. . . Responsibility . All staff and managers of organization assist in implementing the preservation policy . as appropriate to their roles and responsibilities. . . Making  and  keeping  companys  records  depends  on  the  cooperation  of  everyone . involved in the working of the organization. The individual Departments are requested . to ensure that the provisions contained in the Record Retention Schedule which are . developed are strictly followed. . . . . . __________________________ ."

Accounting Policies .  . I.  Property, plant and equipment  . Property, Plant and equipment including capital work in progress are stated at historical . cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The cost . comprises of purchase price, taxes, duties, freight and other incidental expenses directly . attributable and related to acquisition and installation of the concerned assets and are . further adjusted by the amount of input tax credit availed wherever applicable. . . Subsequent costs are included in asset's carrying amount or recognized as separate assets, . as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefit associated with the . item will flow to the Company and the cost of item can be measured reliably. When . significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the . Company depreciates them separately based on their respective useful lives. Likewise, when . a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant . and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and . maintenance costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. The present value of the . expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the . respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met. . . Derecognition: - An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially . recognized is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are . expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset . (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of . the asset) is included in the income statement when the asset is derecognized. Capital work-. in-progress includes cost of property, plant and equipment under installation /under . development as at the balance sheet date. The residual values, useful lives and methods of . depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and . adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. . . Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated on prorata basis on straight-. line method using the useful lives of the assets estimated by management.

Lease hold improvements are depreciated on straight line basis over shorter of the asset's . useful life and their initial agreement period. Leasehold land is amortized on a straight-line . basis over the unexpired period of their respective lease ranging from 90-99 years. . . Separately acquired intangible assets  . Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Cost of . intangible assets acquired in business combination is their fair value at the date of . acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less . accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated . intangibles, excluding capitalized development cost, are not capitalized and the related . expenditure is reflected in statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the . expenditure is incurred. Cost comprises the purchase price and any attributable cost of . bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. . . Research and development cost  . Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditure incurred on an . individual project is recognized as an intangible asset when the Company can demonstrate . all the following:  . i) The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for . use or sale;  . ii) Its intention to complete the asset; . iii) Its ability to use or sale the asset;  . iv) How the asset will generate future economic benefits;  . v) The availability of adequate resources to complete the development and to use or sale . the asset;  . vi) The ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during . development. . Following the initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the cost model . is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and . accumulated impairment losses. Amortization of the asset begins when development is . complete, and the asset is available for use. It is amortized on straight line basis over the . estimated useful life. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment . annually. . . 10 | P a g e  .  . CLASSIFICATION | RESTRICTED .  . The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible . assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful economic lives and assessed for . impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The . amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful . life is reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful . life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the . asset is accounted for by changing the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and . are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible . assets with finite lives is recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the expense . category consistent with the function of the intangible assets. . . Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested for . impairment annually, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment . of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to . be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a . prospective basis. . . Gains or losses arising from disposal of the intangible assets are measured as the difference . between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized . in the statement of profit and loss when the assets are disposed off. . . Intangible assets with finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their . estimated useful life as under .

Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to . amortization and are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or . changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Other assets are tested for . impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may . not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset's . carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of . an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing . impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately . identifiable cash inflows which largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or . groups of assets (cash- generating units). Non - financial assets other than goodwill that . suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of . each reporting period. . . . 11 | P a g e  .  ."
83,Accounting Manual_V1.2.pdf,"IV. Inventories . a.  Basis of Valuation . (i)  Inventories other than scrap materials are valued at lower of cost and net . realizable value after providing cost of obsolescence, if any. However, . materials and other items held for use in the production of inventories are . not written down below cost if the finished products in which they will be . incorporated are expected to be sold at or above cost. The comparison of . cost and net realizable value is made on an item-by-item basis. . (ii)  Inventory of scrap materials have been valued at net realizable value. . . b.  Method of Valuation  . (i)  Cost of raw materials has been determined by using moving weighted . average cost method and comprises all costs of purchase, duties, taxes . (other than those subsequently recoverable from tax authorities) and all . other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and . condition. . (ii)  Cost of finished goods and work-in-progress includes direct labor and an . appropriate share of fixed and variable production overheads and excise . duty as applicable. Fixed production overheads are allocated based on . normal capacity of production facilities. Cost is determined on moving . weighted average basis. . (iii)  Cost of traded goods has been determined by using moving weighted . average cost method and comprises all costs of purchase, duties, taxes . (other than those subsequently recoverable from tax authorities) and all . other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and . condition. . (iv)  Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of . business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary . to make the sale. . . . V.  Revenue Recognition . The Company manufactures/ trades and sells a range of consumer electrical and electronic . products. Sale of these products is recognized at a point in time when control of the product . has been transferred, being when the products are delivered to the customers and there is . no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer's acceptance of the products. . Delivery occurs when the products are shipped to specific location and control has been . transferred to the customers. The Company also provides installation, annual maintenance . and extended warranty services that are either sold separately or bundled together with the . sale of goods. The Company recognizes these service revenues from sales of services over a . time, because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by . the Company. The Company has objective evidence that all criterion for acceptance has . been satisfied. . a.  Sale of Goods . 12 | P a g e  .  . CLASSIFICATION | RESTRICTED .  . Revenue from sale of goods is recognized at the point in time when control of the . goods is transferred to the customer, generally on delivery of the goods. . The Company considers, whether there are other promises in the contract in which . there are separate performance obligations, to which a portion of the transaction price . needs to be allocated. In determining the transaction price for the sale of goods, the . Company allocated a portion of the transaction price to goods bases on its relative . standalone prices and considers the following: - .  . (i)  Variable Consideration . (ii)  Warranty Obligations  . The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of goods measured at the fair . value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns and . allowances, trade discounts and volume rebates. If revenue cannot be reliably . measured, the Company defers revenue recognition until the uncertainty is . resolved. Such provisions give rise to variable consideration and are estimated . at contract inception and updated thereafter. . . The Company generally provides for warranties for general repair of defects. . These warranties are assurance-type warranties consistent with its current . practice and no separate adjustment is being done in books for warranties . provided as per industrial norms. The Company adjust the transaction price for . the time value of money where the period between the transfer of the . promised goods or services to the customer and payment by customer exceed . one year. . However, in certain non-standard contracts in respect of sale of consumer . durable goods, the Company provides extended warranties and such . warranties are termed as service-type warranties and therefore, accounted for . as separate performance obligations to which the Company allocates a portion . of the transaction price. . . In respect of short-term advances from its customers, using the practical . expedient in Ind AS 115, the Company does not adjust the promised amount of . consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if it expects, . at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised . good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or . service will be within normal operating cycle. . In respect of long-term contracts, the Company has used the incremental . borrowing rate to discount the consideration as this is the rate which . commensurate with rate that would be reflected in separate financing . arrangement between the Company and its customer. . . . . (iii)  Discounting of Long-term contract receivables. . 13 | P a g e  .  . CLASSIFICATION | RESTRICTED .  . b.  Sale of Service . The Company provides installation, annual maintenance and extended warranty . services that are either sold separately or bundled together with the sale of goods. . In case of installation services, revenue is recognized at point of delivering installation . services. In case of Annual maintenance and extended warranty services, revenue is . recognized proportionally over the period of services. . . c.  Rental Income . Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is accounted for . on a straight - line basis over the lease terms and is included in other income in the . statement of profit or loss. . . d.  Interest Income . For all liabilities which are presented at fair value in balance sheet due to their long-. term nature are de-discounted using the same interest rate at which they were . discounted earlier, and this de-discounting is recorded as interest income. . . e.  Export benefit  . Revenue from export benefits arising from Duty entitlement pass book (DEPB scheme), . duty drawback scheme, merchandise export incentive scheme is recognized on export . of goods in accordance with their respective underlying scheme at fair value of . consideration received or receivable. . . . . a.  Short-term obligations  . Liabilities for wages and salaries, including nonmonetary benefits that are expected to . be settled wholly within twelve months after the end of the period in which the . employees render the related service are recognized in respect of employee service up . to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amount expected to be . paid when the liabilities are settled. . . b.  Other long-term employee benefit obligations . (i)  Gratuity . The Employee's Gratuity Fund Scheme, which is defined benefit plan, is . managed by Trust with its investments maintained with Life insurance . Corporation. The liabilities with respect to Gratuity Plan are determined by . actuarial valuation on projected unit credit method on the balance sheet date, . based upon which the Company contributes to the Gratuity Scheme. The . difference, if any, between the actuarial valuation of the gratuity of employees . at the year end and the balance of funds is provided for as assets/ (liability) in . the books. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net . defined benefit liability or asset. The Company recognizes the following . VI. Employee benefits . 14 | P a g e  .  .

Remeasurements gain or loss arise due to change in actuarial assumption or . which is than recognized directly in P&L with a corresponding debit/ credit to . retained earnings through other comprehensive income. . . All kind of leases entered in to by Company are dealt with as follows: - .  . a.  Company as Lessee  . If Company has obtained a property on lease, in that case accounting for lease will be . as follows: - . (i)  Term and condition of the agreement are to be analyzed for classification of . lease in to finance and operating lease at point of first rent payment. If lease . terms are such that Company has right to retain the property for more than 1 . year from end of a financial year than such lease will be classified as Finance . lease otherwise same will be classified as operating lease. . (Ex of right to retain the property: - Non-cancellable period of more than 1 . year, right to vacate only with lessee not with lessor)  .  . . (ii)  In case of operating lease, lease payment will continue to be booked under . rent expenses. In case of Finance lease, lease liability and lease asset as on date . of inception of lease are to be recognized at present value of future lease . payment, monthly discounted by interest rate of incremental borrowing for the . lease period. (Non-cancellable period or the period during which right to . vacate lies with lessee) . (iii)  Lease payment related to Finance lease will be deducted from lease liability . recognized. . (iv)  Lease liability will be increased by interest expenses every year at the same . rate at which discounting was done earlier. . (v)  Lease asset will be depreciated on straight line method over the period of . lease. . . b.  Company as lessor .  . If Company has given a property on lease, in that case accounting for lease will be as . follows: - .

Export RNR: - Each export sale agreement has different terms & condition out of which  .        some agreements require sale on Free on board and some require sale on C.I.F. .

Lease accounting is done in accordance with IND AS 116 (Leases), applicable from 01-Apr-. 19. Below mentioned are quick reference from IND as 116. . . Identifying a lease: - At inception of a contract, an entity shall assess whether the contract . is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to . control the use of an identified asset for a period in exchange for consideration. . . Lease term: - An entity shall determine the lease term as non-cancellable period of a lease . together with period covered by an option to extend the lease if the lessee is reasonably . certain to exercise that option or not to exercise the option. . . Recognition at the initial date, a lessee shall recognize a right to use asset and lease . liability.

The company has followed the following policy for compliance with IND AS 116: - .  . Generally, our rent agreements are falling under definition of leases where control of assets . for the lease term is with us for a consideration defined in the agreement. For the . recognition of leases, we have considered leases where non-cancellable period as per . agreement is for more than 1 year or where any leasehold improvement has been . capitalized. All agreement where period of agreement is less than 12 month or without any . non-cancellable period are not considered for the purpose of calculation of leases. . .

Initial recognition: - . Long term lease is recognized as leases where original non-cancellable period is of more . than 12 months are only considered for the purpose of leases accounting. Underlying value . of asset is considered as Purchase value of the premises taken on lease. Lease period is . considered as non-cancellable period plus period of extension (only if option to terminate . the lease is with lessee only) for which lessee expect to extend the lease period based on . future. In case of lease where leasehold improvements have been capitalized in asset . register in that case period of amortization as per fixed asset register is considered as lease . period. Interest rate for the purpose of discounting is considered as incremental rate of . borrowing as obtained from bank on annual basis. After finding all these required details we . have discounted the monthly lease payments over the identified lease period at the . incremental rate of borrowing and right to use asset and lease liability are created in book . of accounts at the calculated present value. Right to use asset is presented under intangible . assets and Lease liability is presented under other financial liabilities. Accounting entry for . the same is as follows: - .  .

(N) Special project accounting . a future event. . charged for the goods. . warranty period. . Special project accounting comes in role when we enter in an agreement in which terms . and condition are different than regular sale. Special project accounting once identified . is dealt with in manner prescribe in Indian accounting standard 115. Following can be an . indicator of a project to be identified as special project: - . (i)  Right to receive consideration is established on happening or non-happening of . (ii)  Consideration for sale of goods or services is not based on day to day price . (iii)  Extended warranty demanded with the sale of goods is more than normal . (iv)  Sale of goods with maintenance services. . If any of the above circumstances are there in a project sale then concern person . informs HO Accounts team. HO accounts team assess the terms and condition and do . the accounting as per IND AS 115 for the project. . As per IND AS 115, transaction price for each performance obligations needs to be . identified separately as per PARA 79 of IND AS 115 based on any one of the following . method: - . (a)  Adjusted market assessment approachan entity could evaluate the market in . which it sells goods or services and estimate the price that a customer in that . market would be willing to pay for those goods or services. That approach might . also include referring to prices from the entitys competitors for similar goods or . services and adjusting those prices as necessary to reflect the entitys costs and . margins. . (b)  Expected cost plus a margin approachan entity could forecast its expected costs of . satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that . good or service. . (c)  Residual approachan entity may estimate the stand-alone selling price by . reference to the total transaction price less the sum of the observable stand-alone . selling prices of other goods or services promised in the contract. However, an . entity may use a residual approach to estimate, the stand-alone selling price of a . good or service only if one of the following criteria is met:  . (i)  The entity sells the same good or service to different customers (at or near . the same time) for a broad range of amounts (ie the selling price is highly . variable because a representative stand-alone selling price is not discernible . from past transactions or other observable evidence); or  . 127 | P a g e  .  . CLASSIFICATION | RESTRICTED .  . (ii)  The entity has not yet established a price for that good or service and the . good or service has not previously been sold on a stand-alone basis (ie the . selling price is uncertain). . . In case a company has transferred a goods or services to customer but right to . receive consideration has not been established than such sale of goods or services . are accounted as Contract asset and if consideration has been received from . customer for future performance obligations than such consideration is recognized . as Contract liability in accordance with IND As 115. . Few example of current project accounting are as follows: - . (a)  Tata power Ludhiana project . In an agreement with Tata power at Ludhiana branch we have agreed to sale street . lights with 8 year warranty period which is more than normal 2 yr warranty provided on . lights. In this case as per IND AS 115, there are two performance obligations sale of . goods which gets completed at point of delivery of goods at site and sale of services . which is provided and consumed by customer over the period of 8 year. As per the . agreement there is no separation of consideration for sale of goods and services, . accordingly as per Para 79 of IND AS 115 we have followed the second approach for . transaction price allocation which is cost plus margin approach. For this purpose we . have taken warranty cost for this project as assessed by CRI team during tender pitching . project Plus mark up and accordingly we have reduced the transaction price with the . same percentage as assessed by CRI team and presented as contract liability in balance . sheet because in this particular contract we receive consideration at point of delivery of . goods. Contract liability is taken back to sale of services proportionately over the period . of extended services. . Accounting for the above mentioned project is as follows at quarter end: - . Suppose if we have billed rs. 16 lakh material to TATA power during the quarter and as . per CRI 10% of the total project will be extended warranty cost for 8 year than we will . reduce the sale price by 10% and following entry will be passed. .

In this project we have to replace old street lights with new LED lights with . maintenance of lights for 7 years. Our consideration for the sale of lights with . extended warranty period will be a defined percentage of cost of electricity saved . due to this changeover. Consideration of sale of Lights and services will be given on . monthly basis which will be equivalent to a defined percentage of electricity saved. . Based on assessment of the project terms and conditions, we find out that there are . two performance obligation one is sale of goods which gets completed when goods . are delivered at customer site and second is warranty service which will get . completed over the period of project. As per the project terms and condition . document to represent completion of performance obligation for sale of goods and . warranty period start from date of completion certificate as given by NDMC  . Now as per IND AS 115, we have done the price allocation based on approach (a) . adjusted market assessment report of Para 79 as in past we have also sold the alike . goods in EESL where consideration price for sale of goods and warranty service was . separate. Accordingly in this project we have booked sale of goods as on the date of . completion certificate based on the no of lights as per completion certificate and a . like lights being sold in past to EESL. .

And after ensuring the . correctness of all the details , the warranty is offered to the customer.. If the product is under warranty period , the Company assigns the call to Franchisee / Own Technician whose job is to go to . the customer site  and check the invoice and batch number and if  he finds it under warranty , he then rectify (or replace the . defective part in the product) the defects without charging anything from the customer.. If after verifying invoice and batch number on the product , technician finds that the product is not under warranty. Then in. the existing call only , call status is changed from in warranty to out warranty call and technician will charge for . replacement/ repair.. After the complaint is resolved to the satisfaction of the customer, the technician prepares a Job Sheet(Manual/Online) in . which all the details of work done are mentioned. This job sheet is signed by both own technician and the customer.. If service request is allocated to own technician, then own technician submits the job sheet (Only if Manual job sheet is . prepared) in concerned branch with returnable defective item.. If service request is allocated to franchise, franchisee technician prepares a Job Sheet (Only if Manual job sheet is . prepared) and submit to franchisee and updates the details in service portal..

Guidelines to Use Local Conveyance Claim through SFA .  . . Multiple  conveyance  modes  can  be  used  &  claimed  in  a  single  day. . (For  example;  user  can  claim  Self  Conveyance  /  Taxi  /  Bus  /  Auto  / . Rickshaw  /  Local  Train). Distance  travelled,  using  other  conveyance . modes  (Bus/Taxi/Auto  etc.)  need  to  be  deducted  from  their  total . distance captured in conveyance claim. .

In . accounting, accrued expenses and provisions are separated by their respective degree . of certainty. . . Accruals: - .   An accrued expense is an accounting term that refers to an expense that is . recognized on the books before it has been paid. . Existence of a liability is certain in the case of accruals. It is only that the . actual settlement is pending and thus the same are accrued in the books. . All accrued expenses have already been incurred but are not yet paid .   The  expense  is  recorded  in  the  accounting  period  in  which  it  is  incurred. . Because  accrued  expenses  represent  a  company's  obligation  to  make . future cash payments. . It will show on a company's balance sheet as current liabilities. . Accrued expense is only an estimate and will likely differ from the suppliers . invoice that will arrive at a later date. . Accruals include accounting for several expenses such as payment of utility . expenses such as rent, electricity, professional fees etc. . Existence of liability in the case of provisions is not entirely certain but is . probable and is depending on the occurrence or non-occurrence of certain . events. . Provisions are far less certain than accruals. . Companies  chosen  to  make  them  for  future  obligations  whose  a  specific . amount or date of incurrence is unknown. . The provisions basically act like a hedge against possible losses that would . impact business operations. .

For immediate month, forecast exercise is run. which involves statistical forecasting, baseline, branch input & final RSM consensus forecasting steps. For Manufacturing & Domestic. traded, M+1 is final and M+2 to M+4 is tentative for RM planning. For import, M+4 is final forecast.. Forecast is an expected unconstrained Sales Forecast which is generated from the very lowest level from where actual sales is. happening e.g. in Havells scenario it is the Sales office & SKU. Forecasting is done for 3 SKU categories: A class, B class & New. For C. class, obsolete & MTO item, order based demand is followed.. From AOP, target closing stock is calculated. Together with sales plan, this is used to generate operations plan for M+1 to M+3 for. manufacturing and M+4 for import. Operation plan is released to the plant. Pre-S&OP is held between SCM planners & Factory PPC to. finalize the production plan and the same is uploaded on the system..

By 2nd of month, Tentative sales plan by value is collected from all sales offices. Statistical forecast is generated by system in . parallel at sales office-sku level. Planners at HO use the 2 inputs above to generate baseline forecast by 6th of the month. On 7th  10th of the month, forecast window is opened for branches for their input. Using baseline forecast and sales history . as reference, the respective Branch Product Head will make corrections to the demand plan by the 10th of every month.. . Branch Corrections are done at SO-SKU level division wise. Input needs to be done keeping in view expected sales for next . month. While branch is entering inputs for sales forecast, it must be done very carefully as higher forecasting may result in. piling up of high inventory level at branches.. After submission of branch input by BPH,  RSM / NPH  review the forecast and input where inconsistency is observed. They . have a discussion with all sales offices where inconsistencies are highlighted and wherever consensus is reached, the . forecast is revised by  RSM / NPH . This will be done by the 14th. Based on final forecast for next month, planners generate operations plan for Factory & Purchase team with week wise . prioritization. The plan takes into account Forecast, Safety stock, sales order pendency, build up requirement and target . closing stock for calculating the requirement. This is shared by 22nd . Against this plan, Factory & Purchase teams share a . committed plan after evaluation at their end based on their capacities & bottlenecks. On 24th & 25th, Planners organize pre-. S&OP meeting with Factory & Purchase team to generate a consensus operations plan and product mix. This plan is . uploaded into the system. SNP-run is carried out at the Head Office on the 20th of every month by SCM Central Team. . Division wise S&OP meetings are held  between 26th & 30th where all stakeholders are brought on board on one plan. SNP run is again carried out on 1st to generate updated distribution requirements due to changed month end stock levels. .

Order Fill Rate refers to the percentage of customer orders that are serviced fully. It is also known as the . demand satisfaction rate because customer satisfaction is closely tied to how many orders that can be . filled by stock on hand. . WHY ORDER FILL RATE IS IMPORTANT . A high order fill rate suggests that we are managing inventory levels efficiently to avoid stock-outs. We . are forecasting demand accurately, replenishing inventory on time, and providing sufficient safety stock. . Thus able to fulfil customer orders fully & timely. . On the flip side, a low order fill rate means Sale loss & we need to get demand planning and Supply . planning in order. . Considering below Scenario  Out of 5 Orders 3 are completely billed. Order Fill Rate is 3/5 =60%. . Out of 10 Order-SKU lines, 7 lines are completely billed. Line Fill Rate will be 7/10=70%. . 0 . Status . Bill . Qty . No of . Lines . Order . Qty . Order . Hit . 1 .

(1) Objective:  . a)  In any manufacturing plant role of a costing person is to drive correct cost . of production for each manufacturing product (FG+Spares+SFG). . b) To  provide  required  analysis  of  normal  and  abnormal  process  losses . (Extra Material Consumption/Rework Cost analysis) of plant. . c)  To  provide  product  wise  profitability  analysis  along  with  reason  for . deviation between projections and actual profitability. . d) To help management to evaluate future projections. . . (2) Material Master Creation and review: .  . . New Material Code Opening and Approval in SAP -   To achieve the goal of . correct costing of any product, it is very essential that material master of . that  plant  should  be  accurate  and  to  ensure  the  same  in  Havells  PPC, . Taxation, Quality and Packaging Team has been deployed for opening and . approve new code. Below are the steps to open and approve any new . code: . i)  Request for any new material code by concern department to PPC . (Production planning & Control) team. . ii)  PPC (Production planning & Control) team initiate new Code in SAP . with all details on the basis of request received. . iii)  After that same code request will reflect with Taxation Team in SAP . to confirm correct HSN code for that item code. Auto e-mail of the . same  is  also  triggered  through  workflow  immediately  after  code . creation by PPC. . iv)  After  approval  by  Taxation  team  an  auto  e-mail  of  the  same  is . triggered through workflow immediately to Quality to validate and . approve QA parameters. . P a g e 3 | 40  .   . CLASSIFICATION | INTERNAL  .  . v)  After  approval  by  QA  team  auto  email  will  triggered  through . workflow immediately to Central Packaging Team to validate and . approve Packaging parameters. . . After final approval new item code is active in SAP for further transactions. . . Check points at the time of creating New Item code: .  . i)  Material Code- It should as per material category/Group which is predefined . as per Coding logic configured in SAP for each material category. . ii)  Material Division: Material Division should be as per product segment like . Havells Fan, REO Fan and Standard Fans. . iii)  Material Type- Correct material type should be selected as per nature of the . material whether it is RM/Packing/SFG/FG/Spare. . iv)  Origin  Group-  It  represent  the  nature  of  material  whether  it  is  related  to . copper/brass/steel etc. . v)  Profit Center- We have defined rules to autofill based on Plant and division, . hence user no need to fill Profit center at the time of code creation. . v)  Valuation  Class-  It  is  most  important  area  because  valuation  class  is  a . connector  between  MM  and  Finance. Valuation  class  is  the  area  which . decides that in which inventory GL and in which consumption GL transaction . of said material  will book  further. This  field is  also taken care by rules to . autofill based on material type, Plant code and division. . vi)  Material Description- There should be regular check on preventing creation . of duplicate material codes. For this validation has already been given in new . MDM tool where it gives a pop up message when description is  matching . 80%  or  90%  and  does  not  allow  creation  when  description  is  matching . 100%.The same should also be reviewed at plant on monthly basis. . . Plant costing team will review all above parameters of total material master on . Quarterly basis to ensure correct accounting and Costing within organisation. . 3)  Activity Rate Calculation -There are two elements of Cost of Production first . is  RM  Cost  &  other  is  manufacturing  overheads. whereas  RM  Cost  is  derived . through BOM which is prepared by PPC (Production planning & Control) team. On . P a g e 4 | 40  .   . CLASSIFICATION | INTERNAL  .  . the other hand to evaluate Mfg. Overhead Routing & Activity rates are required. . Again, Routing data (No. of manpower/No. of machine involved at any process) is . maintained in SAP by PPC (Production planning & Control) team with the help of . production  team. And  calculation  of  activity  rates/Hour  is  done  by . Costing/Commercial  team. Below  step  need  to  be  follow  for  calculating  activity . rates. . i.  Cost Center Wise (Process Wise) Mfg. Exps calculation. . ii. Reallocation of Mfg. OH of Support / service department on production cost . centers. (Reallocation base may vary plant to plant)  . iii. Actual  Labour  calculation  on  the  basis  of  labour  hour  data  provided  by  HR . department. . iv.  Machine  hour  calculation  is  based  on  time  &  motion  study  by  production . department. . v.  Need to calculate Activity Rates based on Actual Capacity Utilisation Quarterly . and change with KP26 wherever required. . . Under  COPA  system  now  system  provide  Activity  rate  on  monthly  basis . depending upon actual expenses incurred and actual production. Same can be . retrieved through Code KSBT: . P a g e 5 | 40  .   . CLASSIFICATION | INTERNAL  .  . . . . 4)  Activity Rate updating in SAP- After calculating activity rates same has to be . maintained  in  SAP. For  this  firstly  we  will  have  to  run  T.Code  KP26  after  which . following screen will reflect. And required inputs will be put as below. . . Version:   In Version Colum please put 0  .

(6) Individual Costing Run (CK11n & CK24)- Generally mass costing run activity is . been performed once in a month if any new product is being launched or produced . after mass costing run than we have to run the costing of that product individually . because without costing run production confirmation is not possible. And for any . emergency  individual  costing  run  and  release  rights  has  been  given  to  PPC . (Production planning & Control) Team as well. To run individual costing below steps . need to be followed. . i)  Firstly  we  will  run  the  T.Code  CK11n  and  will  put  the  required  details  like . Material code/Plant/Costing Variant(qpc1)/Costing version and after putting . all details will press enter button twice and then will save the costing  . P a g e 14 | 40  .   .

(7) Overhead absorption Analysis- As already explained that major role of costing . person is to drive the correct cost of production for all in-house produced products. . There are two element of COP for any Product RM & Mfg Overheads. Whereas RM . cost is driven through BOM and MFG overheads is being loaded though routing. . As we know that there is no direct link between Finance and costing so we have to . do  monthly  analysis  between  actual  and  standard  overhead  absorb  through . production confirmation so that in case of any variance corrective measures can be . taken. . Major areas of overhead absorption analysis:  .   Installed Capacity:  It is declared production capacity (For FG) of any plant. . Based on installed machines/infrastructure. Refer IEM of plant. . Normal Capacity: It is such production numbers which a plant can achieve in . case  of  normal  circumstances  (No  issue  of  material/labour/demand/other . resources required for production)  .   Actual Production- Actual production is such production numbers (FG) which . has been credited in FG store during analysis period. We can retrieve actual . production from SAP by using MB51 T.Codes. . P a g e 17 | 40  .   . CLASSIFICATION | INTERNAL  .  . . . . . . . . Capacity utilization update in SAP- KB31N Here we had created head wise . Cost centre for overhead absorption on the basis of Normal Capacity.

(Assigned in BOM) got consumed automatically at the time of order confirmation . but in few cases material (which is assigned in BOM) as well as which is not assigned . in BOM has to consume manually. This consumption is booked through using of 201 . (consumption) 202 (Generation) M.type. Reason of all these types of consumption . are as follows: .   Normal process losses which are not taken care in BOM  .   Material used in rework  . P a g e 20 | 40  .   . CLASSIFICATION | INTERNAL  .  . Material Substitution of similar components. . Such materials which are not assigned in BOM like consumables. . To  analyse  this  manual  consumption  report  can  be  retrieved  through  SAP  using . MB51 T.Code  or BW report of 202-202. .

It is expected that significant portion of these costs will be incurred in the next financial year and all will have been incurred within . two years after the reporting date. . Assumptions used to calculate the provisions for warranties were based on current sales levels and current information available. about returns based on one to two years warranty period for all products sold.. The defective goods are received from branch by the plant and CWH .  For the purpose of booking of provision at the year end , Actuarial Valuation Certificate for warranty provision is also obtained. . Provision for Franchisee expenses . On the basis of call report generated from service portal by branch service manager, a journal voucher is passed in the books of. accounts in which Call expense is debited and provision for call expense is credited.. In the immediately following month, the branch service manager sends an invoice specifying the complaints attended in that . month.. Branch service manager verifies the bill from service portal, approves the bill and selects vendor credit SAP.

Information Security Incident Management . Information security  incident  management  details  handling of  potential information security event . through the investigation and evaluation process  to ensure that information security incidents are . addressed  in  a  timely  and  effective  manner  and  in  accordance  with  Havells  Information  Security . Policy, procedures, and legal requirements. When necessary, procedures for the timely notification to . employees, and all other parties who may be impacted by the incident are initiated, and appropriate . remedial actions are taken. . The objectives of Information security incident management are as follows: . a)  Ensure  that  information  security  events  and  vulnerabilities  associated  with  information . systems are communicated in a manner allowing timely corrective actions to be taken; . b)  Ensure that a consistent and effective approach is applied to the management of information . security incidents . Havells must be prepared to deal with numerous types of information security related events and . incidents, including Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, malicious code/ malware infection, unauthorized . access, inappropriate usage (violating acceptable use policies), and data breaches (an incident in . which confidential data is lost or stolen; the integrity of confidential data is/ was affected; . confidential data was/ is subject to unlawful disclosure). . In order to protect Havells network and the information stored and processed, Havells' network . must have consistent processes for reporting, tracking, and managing security events and incidents. . This includes defining how Havells' network will respond when it is notified of a potential security . event and incident.. . Table 4 Steps involved in information security incident management .  . 2.9.1. Reporting security incidents . a)  All information security incidents must be reported  at: . i.  Email: soc@havells.com / ITsupport.Helpdesk@Havells.com; and . ii. Report it through telephone via IT Helpdesk at: 0120-477-2399. . b)  Employees  shall  be  made  aware  of  their  responsibilities  for  reporting  information  security . event and incidents; . Page 10 of 16 .  . . Havells India Limited . Havells India Incident Management Policy . Version 1.0 . Internal .  . . c)  Where it is required to report information security incidents to outside authorities to comply . with legal or regulatory requirements, this shall only be done by ISH/matrix approved by ISH; . d)  All the suspected/potential/detected/actual incidents shall be reported. Such incidents shall . include, but not limited to: . i.  Any  data  breach,  loss  of  data/  information,  intellectual  capital,  software,  or  physical . assets (or confidential information), transfer to an unauthorized recipient, including, for . example, information on laptops, smart-phones, USB devices, documents and working . papers; . ii. If any Havells personnel believe that their credentials may have been compromised or . lost, or in the event that  access device is lost or stolen; . iii. Any actual or suspected malware infection causing potential disclosure of information or . loss of control of the device; . iv.  Any violation of the Acceptable Usage Policy; and . v.  Any  identified  information  security  weaknesses  and  vulnerabilities  (under  no . circumstances should any Havells personnel or Third-Party attempt to test or exploit an . identified weakness or vulnerability unless it is within their job responsibility to do so). . 2.9.2. Incident Prioritization . Information Security Incident handling shall be prioritize based on the following guidelines:  . a)  Current and Potential Technical Impact, likelihood of the Incident:  Incident handlers should . consider  not  only  the  current  negative  impact  of  the  incident  (For  example:  unauthorized . user-level access to data), but also the likely future technical impact of the incident if it is not . immediately  contained  (For  example:  root  level  compromise). For  example,  a  malware . spreading among workstations may currently cause a minor effect on the business operations, . but within a few hours, the malwares s impact on network traffic may cause a major network . outage; and . b)  Criticality  of  affected  Resources  and/or  Information  Assets:    Resources  affected  by  an . incident  (For example:  firewalls, web servers, Internet  connectivity, user workstations, and . applications etc.) have different significance to different business operations. The criticality . of a resource is based primarily on its information or services, users, trust relationships and . interdependencies with other resources, and visibility (For example: a public web server / E-. com Portal versus an internal web server). . .

Risk transfer involves a decision to share certain risks with external/ internal parties. Risk transfer can . create new risks or modify existing, identified risks. Therefore, additional risk assessment followed by . risk  treatment  may  be  necessary. Transfer  can  be  done  by  insurance  that  shall  support  the . consequences, or by sub-contracting a partner whose role shall be to monitor the information system . and take immediate actions to stop an attack before it makes a defined level of damage. . 2.1.6.4  Risk Treatment .

A  treatment  plan  shall  be  prepared  for  each . identified risk as per the risk assessment performed. . To  facilitate  the  implementation  of  the  risk  treatment  plan,  an  action  plan  shall  be  prepared,  and . responsibility  shall  be  assigned  for  implementing  the  recommended  controls. The  plan  shall  also . clearly highlight the expected and actual closure date of implementation. . 2.1.6.5  Closure Responsibility, Target Completion Date and Status . Details  (Name,  role,  etc.)  of  the  person  responsible  for  the  closure  of  the  risk  identified  will  be . captured along with the target date of completion for the same and the status of risk closure. . Once  recommended  controls  have  been  identified,  residual  risk  value  shall  be  computed  with  the . same approach as followed for Risk Rating to identify if the residual risk value is at acceptable level . or additional controls need to be defined to mitigating the risks. . 2.1.6.6  Management approval . It  is  the  responsibility  of  respective  department  head  to  present  risk  treatment  plan  to  the . management for approval, and regularly update on the progress of RTP. . 2.2  Site Risk Assessment .

Risk identification can come from a variety of sources such as internal and external audit, regulatory . reviews, self-assessments, etc. Risk identification is to be an ongoing and continual process across . Havells. . . a)  Risk  identified  shall  be  analyzed  to  identify  existing  controls  within  the  environment  and . evaluates the effectiveness of controls in lowering the identified risk; . b)  The output of the  risk  identification shall contain a description of the risks  and of potential . consequences as well as current (existing) and a residual (post mitigation) risk rating for each . risk based on a combination of the impact of an event occurring and the likelihood of the event . occurring; . c)  The risk evaluation shall determine the overall risk rating and the severity of the risk; . d)  Risk evaluation must  leverage  the  risk  metric  define in  this standard to  ensure  a  consistent . understanding and interpretation of risks within Havells; . e)  Each Risk must be assigned to, and accepted by, a Risk Owner and is the responsibility of that . Risk Owner. . . a)  Risk Owners must formally either Treat, Accept, Transfer or Terminate their risks; . b)  In order to manage their risks, and in accordance with the risk appetite defined in this policy, . risk owners may: . i.  Terminate a risk - avoiding the risk by deciding not to start or continue with the activity . that gives rise to the risk; . ii. Transfer a risk - sharing the risk with another party or parties through contracts, insurance . or risk financing; . iii. Treat a risk - reducing the risk by removing the risk source to reduce the likelihood and/or . consequences; . iv.  Accept  a  risk  -  retaining  the  risk  following  an  informed  decision  and  evaluating  the . anticipated decisions; . c)  When treating a risk, a risk treatment plan (which can consist in one or more actions) must be . formally developed to an acceptable level. . .

CLASSIFICATION | PUBLIC. . SAP PM Overview. CLASSIFICATION | PUBLIC. . DEFINITIONS. 1) SAP PLANT MAINTENANCE MODULE:. SAP Plant Maintenance (SAP PM) is software that manages all maintenance activities in an organization. All the. activities that are performed under maintenance are interconnected and hence this module is closely. integrated with other modules - Production Planning, Material Management, and Sales and Distribution.. Using SAP PM, we can perform automatic repairs and facilitate maintenance requests in an organization. It. allows us to record problems in SAP system, plan labor and material activities, and to record and settle the cost.. 2) MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES:. HOD Maintenance and his assigned delegates are responsible to co-ordinate and carry out various activities. listed in this procedure, to maintain Plants and machines in good working condition and to ensure its. availability for production function.. a) Breakdown maintenance:- Unplanned shut down of machine due to a failure. Repair involves all measures that. can be performed to restore the ideal condition. Ex:-Gear damage during the running of machine. b) Autonomous maintenance:- Machine lubrication and checks carried by operator on daily basis to prevent. failure at the start of shift/change of machine programme. Ex:- Lubrication change in machine.. CLASSIFICATION | PUBLIC. . c) Preventive maintenance:- Preventive maintenance is used to maintain high availability of the technical system.. It includes maintenance planning and work scheduling activities for technical objects. Machine lubrication and. checks carried out by maintenance fitter carried out at specified interval. It contains checks more than. autonomous maintenance. Ex:- greasing, lubrication or regular check-up of machine as per instruction in check. sheet.. d) Predictive maintenance:- Machine condition checked by maintenance fitter/supervisor with instrument to. detect pre matured failure. These checks carried out at a specified interval or data based on autonomous checks.. Ex:-Machine vibration check.. e) Running machine work:- Work carried out on a machine part when the machine is running. Ex:- 2 Pintle out of. 74 pintals repair while machine is running. f) Project and development work:- New development / modification in the existing machine are carried out as. per requirement of production Dept.. g) New machine/Equipment installation:  Installation and commissioning work of new machine/equipment in the . plant are carried out as and when required. CLASSIFICATION | PUBLIC. . 3) MASTER DATA IN SAP PM:-. Master data in SAP PM contains Functional location, Equipment, Work centres, Measuring point counters.. Functional location. A functional location represents the place at which a maintenance task is to be performed. A large assembly line/ . Machine/ Plant. The master record for a functional location contains the following data groups:. Location and maintenance data- This data includes, for example, maintenance plant and cost center, structure        . indicator, superior functional location and the maintenance planning group responsible.. Partner data- This is data that describes a certain responsibility for a functional location, for example, supplier, . purchaser, responsible employee.. Equipment. The business object ""Equipment"" is an individual, physical object that is to be maintained independently. It may be . a machine in an assembly line or a part of a machine. Ex_ Gluing machine or Loyalty machine in packing line . assembly.. Work center:-. Work centre represents the reference object for a maintenance order: A work centre is a person who is in-charge . of team when a maintenance task is performed. In maintenance it is Fitter name. At the same time, in Production, . this work centre represents a machine. Ex- Mohan lal in HT plant mechanical maintenance.. CLASSIFICATION | PUBLIC. . 4) Maintenance planner:. Maintenance planners help develop strategies for preventive and predictive maintenance systems. Maintenance . planner is the person who creates Functional locations/Equipment/Work centres. These professionals work closely . with the maintenance managers to build reliable maintenance systems and teams.. 5) Maintenance plant:. Maintenance plant for a technical object is known as a plant in which we perform the maintenance tasks for the. objects and planning is done. (Eg: 1350 for Cable or 1351 for wire). 6) Planner groups:. The purpose of Planner Group is to identify the person or group of people who organise the maintenance to be. carried out on the Technical Object. Ex- Maintenance team of a particular section of the plant. 7) Maintenance notification:. It is used to notify maintenance department about an abnormal or exceptional situation(s) in technical objects at . the plant. It is also used for planned maintenance activity and to notify planners. Tasks can be defined in notifications, . which can be used for reporting and analysis.. CLASSIFICATION | PUBLIC. . Notification Types are. M1-Preventive maintenance notification. M2-Predictive maintenance notification. M3-Sustainability data entry. M4-Breakdown maintenance. M5-Project and development. M6-Running machine work. M7-Autonomous maintenance.

For manufacturing of Fans raw materials are received from several vendors and sub contractors. The key processes involved are as. follows:. Machine Shop: Rotor castings , top & bottom castings are machined for their ovality, squarness and standard dimensions in a . special purpose machine. Once homogenization of standard dimensions is done, patrolling quality inspection of rotor, top and . bottom castings takes place. In case of rotors, lacquer is applied for colour codification in order to segregate them as per the. different fan models. The process of lacquering also protects rotor from corrosion.. Paint shop: Top and bottom covers are polymer coated with eco-polymers after which primer is applied onto them. Primer is . baked in the oven post which the quality inspection of primer takes place. If any defects in primer coating are observed, the solid . colour top / bottom covers are sent for wet sanding. After the wet sanding, final solid colour painting takes place. The solid coloured . top bottom covers are sent for baking at 120-125 degree centegrate for 20 minutes. A final quality inspection happens at this stage . before the top and bottom covers are sent to the assembly line.. In case of metallic colours, a similar process as that of solid colours is followed, except that a dual coat of paint (wet on wet) is . applied and baked before finally applying lacquer (which is then again baked). Lacquer helps in protection of the paint quality.. Stator Shop: There is automatic slot insertion machine for automatically inserting insulation papers in the stator slots. Winding is . done on automatic high speed winding machine for both main winding and auxiliary winding. Thereafter quality inspection (High. voltage and open circuit testing) of main and auxiliary winding is done. Stator castings are varnished (the total varnishing and. baking cycle takes approximately six hours to complete). This is followed by colour specific looping of stators which is done to. classify them into different models. A 100% quality test of all stators is done at this stage through surge machines. After surging, a . spindle is inserted into the semi finished stators. Grinding of stator Outside Diameter (OD) is done for maintaining standard. dimensions. Lacquer is applied on the stator for colour codification in order to segregate them as per the different fan models. The . process of lacquering also protects stator from corrosion. .

Blade Shop: It starts with the fabrication of blade which is done in press shop by shearing machine and mechanical presses. . These blade castings are directly procured from vendors by HIL. All blades are coated with Alchrome chemical which facilitates. better application of paint on the blade surface. Riveting of shank with blade leaf is done on 50 ton presses. Then the semi finished . fan blade castings are sent to the paint shop for painting. Post painting, angling and balancing of fan blades is done (incase of . decorative of models, a trim is fixed on the blades leafs). The final quality tested blade leafs are sent for packing to the assembly . line.. Assembly Line: There is an overhead conveyor and single belt conveyor for assembling fans. Assembly line is equipped with . pressure controlled pneumatic press for bearing pressing, pneumatic screwdrivers and quality testing facilities like high voltage . test, low voltage starting test and no load input testing panel.. A daily assembly production plan is prepared by the production head. Based on this plan. semi finished items are collected from . respective factory shops."

CLASSIFICATION | PUBLIC. . SAP PM Overview. CLASSIFICATION | PUBLIC. . DEFINITIONS. 1) SAP PLANT MAINTENANCE MODULE:. SAP Plant Maintenance (SAP PM) is software that manages all maintenance activities in an organization. All the. activities that are performed under maintenance are interconnected and hence this module is closely. integrated with other modules - Production Planning, Material Management, and Sales and Distribution.. Using SAP PM, we can perform automatic repairs and facilitate maintenance requests in an organization. It. allows us to record problems in SAP system, plan labor and material activities, and to record and settle the cost.. 2) MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES:. HOD Maintenance and his assigned delegates are responsible to co-ordinate and carry out various activities. listed in this procedure, to maintain Plants and machines in good working condition and to ensure its. availability for production function.. a) Breakdown maintenance:- Unplanned shut down of machine due to a failure. Repair involves all measures that. can be performed to restore the ideal condition. Ex:-Gear damage during the running of machine. b) Autonomous maintenance:- Machine lubrication and checks carried by operator on daily basis to prevent. failure at the start of shift/change of machine programme. Ex:- Lubrication change in machine.. CLASSIFICATION | PUBLIC. . c) Preventive maintenance:- Preventive maintenance is used to maintain high availability of the technical system.. It includes maintenance planning and work scheduling activities for technical objects. Machine lubrication and. checks carried out by maintenance fitter carried out at specified interval. It contains checks more than. autonomous maintenance. Ex:- greasing, lubrication or regular check-up of machine as per instruction in check. sheet.. d) Predictive maintenance:- Machine condition checked by maintenance fitter/supervisor with instrument to. detect pre matured failure. These checks carried out at a specified interval or data based on autonomous checks.. Ex:-Machine vibration check.. e) Running machine work:- Work carried out on a machine part when the machine is running. Ex:- 2 Pintle out of. 74 pintals repair while machine is running. f) Project and development work:- New development / modification in the existing machine are carried out as. per requirement of production Dept.. g) New machine/Equipment installation:  Installation and commissioning work of new machine/equipment in the . plant are carried out as and when required. CLASSIFICATION | PUBLIC. . 3) MASTER DATA IN SAP PM:-. Master data in SAP PM contains Functional location, Equipment, Work centres, Measuring point counters.. Functional location. A functional location represents the place at which a maintenance task is to be performed. A large assembly line/ . Machine/ Plant. The master record for a functional location contains the following data groups:. Location and maintenance data- This data includes, for example, maintenance plant and cost center, structure        . indicator, superior functional location and the maintenance planning group responsible.. Partner data- This is data that describes a certain responsibility for a functional location, for example, supplier, . purchaser, responsible employee.. Equipment. The business object ""Equipment"" is an individual, physical object that is to be maintained independently. It may be . a machine in an assembly line or a part of a machine. Ex_ Gluing machine or Loyalty machine in packing line . assembly.. Work center:-. Work centre represents the reference object for a maintenance order: A work centre is a person who is in-charge . of team when a maintenance task is performed. In maintenance it is Fitter name. At the same time, in Production, . this work centre represents a machine. Ex- Mohan lal in HT plant mechanical maintenance.. CLASSIFICATION | PUBLIC. . 4) Maintenance planner:. Maintenance planners help develop strategies for preventive and predictive maintenance systems. Maintenance . planner is the person who creates Functional locations/Equipment/Work centres. These professionals work closely . with the maintenance managers to build reliable maintenance systems and teams.. 5) Maintenance plant:. Maintenance plant for a technical object is known as a plant in which we perform the maintenance tasks for the. objects and planning is done. (Eg: 1350 for Cable or 1351 for wire). 6) Planner groups:. The purpose of Planner Group is to identify the person or group of people who organise the maintenance to be. carried out on the Technical Object. Ex- Maintenance team of a particular section of the plant. 7) Maintenance notification:. It is used to notify maintenance department about an abnormal or exceptional situation(s) in technical objects at . the plant. It is also used for planned maintenance activity and to notify planners. Tasks can be defined in notifications, . which can be used for reporting and analysis.. CLASSIFICATION | PUBLIC. . Notification Types are. M1-Preventive maintenance notification. M2-Predictive maintenance notification. M3-Sustainability data entry. M4-Breakdown maintenance. M5-Project and development. M6-Running machine work. M7-Autonomous maintenance. M8-HR notification (To be made). M9-Tools calibration (To be made). 8) Maintenance order:. Maintenance order is used to enter data for maintenance activities carried out. It contains work done carried out by . fitters and correspondence with store for spare part requirement.. Order Types are:. PM01- Preventive maintenance order. PM02-Predictive maintenance order. PM03-Sustainability data order. PM04-Breakdown maintenance. PM05-Project and development. PM06-Running machine work. PM07-Autonomous maintenance. PM08-HR Order (To be made).

RFT is an indicator to measure efficiency of N100 passed in first attempt & product launch on time                   . (excluding material unavailability). . RFT shall be measured for all local inhouse & outsource project (excluding China). . During N100 all Critical & Major observation shall be noted. . To be Excluded: . -> Minor observations  . -> Legacy Defects: If Rejection PPM of defects  Average rejection PPM of similar part during routine production . For details refer E .   CFT team to categorized observations as MSDPIO  . M - Manufacturing . S   - Supplier/Component . D  - Design/Validation . P  - Packaging . I   - Installation/Service . O - others .   RFT % shall be calculated as per formula mentioned in A. . Line DPU (Defect per unit) & Project DPP (Defective per project) shall be calculated for Critical & Major . observations as per formula mentioned in B. . YTD RFT summary shall be published as per table mentioned in C. . Summary of root cause & actions taken against observations shall be periodically reviewed through tracker  . Refer D. . . RFT Calculation Methodology  .  . A) RFT Calculation: . RFT % YTD =     Total No of N100 cleared in First attempt X 100 .                              Total N100 conducted         .  . B) Line DPU & Project DPP .     Line DPU (Defect per unit) =      Total Counts of Defect Observed  .                                                            Total Units Checked         .  . For example, if 100 Units checked & find 3 defects of Critical category & 10 defects of Major category  . then Line DPU calculation will be   .                                                . Line DPU =      3+103+10 =   13    = 0.13 .                           100       100        100 .    . Project DPP (Defect per project) = Sum of different types of Critical & Major observations per project during N100 . Ytd. Project DPP = Cumulative Sum of Individual Project DPP in the financial year .  . Example:  If in Project A, 1 type Critical observation (having 3 Defects) is due to Design & 1 type of Major observation having . (5 defects) is due to Packaging. . Then Project A DPP = 1+1 = 2  .                                          1 . If in Project B & C, there is no observation then YTD Project DPP (A+B+C) = 2+0+0  =   2    =  0.67 .                                                                                                                                       1+1+1       3 . 5 .  . . . 1.1 Quality Risk Assessment. . .

Guideline Owner  Naresh Khandelwal  Approval  Lokesh Pandey  .  . Recommended Action (s): . o  In general, prevention actions (i.e., reducing the occurrence) are preferable to detection . actions. An example of this is the use of process design error proofing rather than random . quality checks or associated inspection. . o  The  intent  of  any  recommended  action  is  to  reduce  rankings  in  the  following  order: . Severity, occurrence, and detection. . o  If action priority is high then action(s) is initiated to reduce the Occurrence rate. . o  High action priorities value must have an action plan. . o  All BiQ Characteristics with RPN  100 and Severity  7 should have action plan to Reduce . RPN and Strengthen Prevention / Detection Controls. . Following approach can be taken to reduce these are explained below: . o  To Reduce the Severity: Only a design or process revision can bring about a reduction in . the severity ranking. . o  To Reduce Occurrence ranking: To reduce occurrence, process and design revisions may . be  required. A  reduction  in  the  occurrence  ranking  can  be  effected  by  removing  or . controlling one or more of the causes of the failure mode through a product or process . design revision. . o  To Reduce Detection ranking: The preferred method is the use of error/mistake Proofing. . A  redesign  of  the  detection  methodology  may  result  in  a  reduction  of  the  detection . ranking. . If  the  assessment  leads  to  no  recommended  actions  for  a  specific  failure . mode/cause/control combination, indicates this by entering None in this column. It may . be useful to also include rationale if None is entered, especially in case of high severity. . Responsibility  &  Target  completion  date:  Enter  the  name  of  the  individual  and .

Guideline Owner  Naresh Khandelwal  Approval  Lokesh Pandey  .  . Purpose . The purpose of this guideline is to define product traceability system that allows complete and up to date . histories of all batches upto final assembly of product. Identification to the product is provided during . manufacturing by unique and controlled numbering system. . . The organization shall use suitable means (Bar code, QR code, Number plate etc.) to identify outputs when it is . necessary to ensure the conformity of products and its services. It shall identify the status of outputs with . respect to monitoring and measurement requirements throughout production and testing provision. . . The organization shall control the unique identification of the outputs when traceability is a requirement, and . shall retain the documented information necessary to enable traceability. . . Scope .  . The guideline applies, as appropriate, to the identification & traceability of products at various stages of . manufacturing. . . Responsibility .  . 1) Production Manager .   Ensures  all  key  persons  working  on  line  are  aware  of  their  responsibilities  consistent  with  the . requirements and documented records to be provided. . 2) Supervisor .   Ensures  all  operators  working  on  various  manufacturing  stages  are  aware  of  their  responsibility  with . regards to the identification of materials and products including the control of nonconforming items. . Maintains records with regards to various stages of manufacturing in the form of Inspection and Test . Records as per control plan. . 3) Operator .   Responsible for identification marking and records as directed by the Supervisor. . . Procedure:  .  . Product Identification & Traceability .  . WIP material to be identified by appropriate identification Tags. Example: Red Tag for rejection, Green Tag . for OK, Yellow for Rework/Hold material. .

On  new  purchase  the  calibration  certificate will  be taken  from  supplier which  will  be  valid  for . initial frequency. Records to be maintained before addition in the Master List of Instruments. . Instrument like measuring tapes, try square, steel rules which are being used in house are put in . general category. They are not calibrated but they are replaced with new if they are damaged. . Selection  of  Laboratories  for  calibration  will  be  done  based  on  their  NABL  accreditation  and . scope of calibration. . Designated Person/Deptt. arranges for calibration to be carried out (or the equipment to be sent . for Calibration) on or before the due date as indicated in Calibration History Card. . Designated person/Deptt. Shall ensure that all instruments/Testing Equipments are integrated in . Calibration Management System through SAP. .

For In-house calibration, a Calibration Work Instruction shall be prepared & maintained for each . & every type of instrument as per the master list of calibration. Calibration shall be carried out as . per work instructions. . For in-house dimensional calibration/verification of gauges, pl. ensure temperature and humidity . conditions (20  2 C, 40% to 60% Relative humidity) are maintained. Stabilize the measuring . instrument  for  a  min.  of  4  Hrs. in  the  required  temperature  and  humidity  conditions  before . starting calibration. . For  external  calibration,  ensure  that  External  laboratory  is  NABL  accredited. Instrument  being . calibrated is defined in the scope of NABL accreditation. NABL accreditation is current and valid. . The calibration of inspection measuring and test equipment carried out externally is controlled . by calibration certificate issued by the external agency. . A re-assessment of the calibration frequency is carried out annually, and the frequency of calibration . is amended (if required) after taking into consideration the following aspects: .

Code (as . per Master List), Date of Calibration & Due Date of Calibration. . However, where labeling of calibration status is not practicable, either because it may interfere . with  the  usage,  or  it would  become  soon  illegible  then  in  such  cases,  the  label  is  affixed  in  a . manner where it is possible to relate to the equipment. . The  Instruments  found  out  of  calibration  are  identified  clearly  by  affixing  them  NOT  for  USE . label, and are stored separately in order to avoid its unintended use. . If, due to any unforeseen circumstances, an inspection, measuring & test equipment cannot be . calibrated within due date, it shall be removed from its point of usage or shall be identified . NOT TO BE USED (for inspection)."

For selection of the laboratory, verify the laboratory scope for the required parameter, range and . calibration measurement capability (CMC) against each calibration range/ parameter. . 7.  The laboratory which have full range of equipment calibration with best CMC should be preferred. In . case limited calibration is available, ensure application range is calibrated. . . Review of Calibration Certificates: .   After calibration of measuring & test equipment, calibration agency handover the equipment to . concerned person who is responsible for taking care of it. . Calibration agency paste the label of calibration on the equipment which calibration is done. Verify . the equipment nomenclature, ID number/serial number, calibration date, Due date mentioned on the . label. . When calibration certificate is issued by the calibration agency, it should be reviewed within 15 days . from the date of issue. . Calibration certificate should have NABL logo along with lab certificate number (just below the NABL . logo). Refer Section  1 of Calibration Certificate in next page. . All NABL Accredited lab should provide Unique Lab Report (ULR) number on each certificate. Refer . Section  2 of Calibration Certificate in next page. . Calibration Agency details e.g. Name, Address, contact details should be available in the certificate. . Refer Section  3 of Calibration Certificate in next page. . Customer details should be verified and it should also be correct. Refer Section  4 of Calibration . Certificate in next page. . Next Verify the unit under calibration (UUC) details mentioned in the certificate and these details . should match with the equipment, i.e. Name, Range, Resolution, Accuracy etc. Also ID Number or . Serial Number and calibration date/due date mentioned on calibration certificate should match . exactly with the details available on calibration label. Refer Section  5 of Calibration Certificate in . next page. . Traceability information should be verified in which below mentioned details should be available: .

Calibration laboratory provides measurement results or calibration results in tabular form or in . separate section which covers reference reading/standard equipment reading, unit under calibration . reading, error and expanded uncertainty for each result. . . First of all check the calibration results for entire equipment range coverage, i.e. full calibration or . limited calibration is provided. . If limited calibration is provided, ensure that the equipment measurement points which are used in . application are covered in calibration, if the point at which particular equipment will be used at shop . floor is not calibrated then remove the equipment from the workplace and sent it back for . recalibration for specific point of application. . It is advisable that before calibration of equipment, inform to calibration personnel for equipment . application range so that most calibration points can be provided for the application range. . . . Equipment verification: fit for Use . Verify the error provided in the calibration certificate which is UUC Reading- Reference Reading. Expanded . uncertainty will also available for each calibrated parameter/ measurement point. Acceptability of calibration . results can be done on the basis of below 2 rules: .  . . . . 162 .  . . . . . 4.10 Interpretation of Calibration . Certificates .  . Department: Corporate Quality .        MEASUREMENT ERROR < ACCURACY      :         ACCEPTABLE .        MEASUREMENT ERROR > ACCURACY      :         NOT ACCEPTABILE . Guideline #  CQ/QAP/037 . Revision No./ Date  00/15.05.2020 . Initial Date  15.05.2020 . Total Page #  8 (Eight) . Implementation Date  01.06.2020 . Guideline Owner  Naresh Khandelwal  Approval  Lokesh Pandey  .  . . . Rule: 1. Check the equipment specifications from the user manual received from manufacturer, look for the . accuracy specification and get the value. Relation of Measurement error with equipment accuracy as . mentioned below: .  . . . . Note: 1 For equipment fit for use, user shall review the measurement error associated with each . measurement result and this error should be less than the accuracy of the equipment which is mentioned in . user manual of the equipment. . . Note: 2 Linearity results also need to review for the entire range of equipment, i.e. bias for entire range of . equipment should be linear. . . Note: 3 If Equipment linearity results is not ok then it should be discarded from the application. . . . . Rule: 2. For critical processes, process tolerances need to focus and the acceptance criteria while considering . process tolerance is that: .  . MEASUREMENT ERROR < 1/10 (PROCESS TOLERANCE)            :         ACCEPTABLE .        MEASUREMENT ERROR > 1/10 (PROCESS TOLERANCE)            :         NOT ACCEPTABILE .  . . Note: 1 It is important to note that process tolerance will be specific for each process and the measurement . error need to be checked for point of application. . . Note: 2 User still can use this equipment if the measurement error provided for each measurement is . considered as correction factor while perform the measurement. . . . . For example, in above calibration certificate, for 30 kg measurement, error is provided as -0.005 kg and for a . specific process, process tolerance is defined as 0.01 kg then 1/10 of 0.01 kg is 0.001 kg then it is clear that . this particular weighing balance is not suitable for that process. If this case is arises then it depends on the . user either he can discard the equipment or can use along with correction factor but if used with correction . factor which is 0.005 kg while take the measurement on 30 kg. Then the True Measurement = Measured . Value + Correction factor .  . . Correction factor =  (Measurement Error) .  . 163 .  . . . . 4.10 Interpretation of Calibration . Certificates .  .

Order Fill Rate refers to the percentage of customer orders that are serviced fully. It is also known as the . demand satisfaction rate because customer satisfaction is closely tied to how many orders that can be . filled by stock on hand. . WHY ORDER FILL RATE IS IMPORTANT . A high order fill rate suggests that we are managing inventory levels efficiently to avoid stock-outs. We . are forecasting demand accurately, replenishing inventory on time, and providing sufficient safety stock. . Thus able to fulfil customer orders fully & timely. . On the flip side, a low order fill rate means Sale loss & we need to get demand planning and Supply . planning in order. . Considering below Scenario  Out of 5 Orders 3 are completely billed. Order Fill Rate is 3/5 =60%. . Out of 10 Order-SKU lines, 7 lines are completely billed. Line Fill Rate will be 7/10=70%. . 0 . Status . Bill . Qty . No of . Lines . Order . Qty . Order . Hit . 1 .

If Amount > Tax = Amount is to be paid, and same shall be treated as Output tax liability. This will have to be reported in . GSTR 1.

Purchase cost of Asset : Rs. 50,000 + GST@18% (9000) = Rs. 59,000, ITC Taken = Rs. 9,000. Asset used for 4 Yrs and 7 Months, so balance life = 5 months, So ITC of balance useful life = 9000 x 5/60 = Rs. 750. (Amount). Lets Assume actual consideration is Rs. 4000, Tax determined = 4000 x 18% = Rs. 720 (Tax). Now on comparing Amount and Tax i.e Rs. 750 and Rs. 720, Amount is greater. Therefore Rs. 750 is payable and has to be. reported in GSTR 1. Therefore Tax Invoice has to be prepared in this case with Invoice Value as Rs. 4000+750 = Rs.. 4,750, However taxable value to be reported in invoice and GSTR 1 will be Rs. 4167.

Author Amit Katiyar .  . . . ABSTRACT .       The tool management enables to get the number of tools in an enterprise its associated components,        . its life , balance life , number of cavity etc. i.e. a history of tools , the expenses incurred due to repair  . on a particular tool or total expense on a particular business location. It also help to get the data to . analyze the current capacity and to plan for future capacity of the components .The current automa-. tion in tool management in Havells have below features : .   Proper Mapping of FA Asset Number to Tool Number and component to be manufactured. . Tool Life Cycle Management .   Notification of End of Life  .   Addition of Tool Life on Refurbishing .   Alert for Preventive Maintenance  .   Capture Tool Wise expenses on Repair, modification, R&D, Preventive Maintenance and Refur-. bishing. . Tool History Card  . The manual will help to understand the overall flow and guide for the steps and procedure to manage    . a tool .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . Author Amit Katiyar .  . . . Code Processing- .                                  . The initial process is code processing . A new code will be processed for any new . tool  i.e. mould/ press tool or PDC mould . For inhouse production , means the location having tool room, two . codes should be processed one final code i.e. tool code and another UT-code (semi finished ) code and for pur-. chase a new tool one code i.e. final code is sufficient. The tool code is processed in material type-4000 and UT . or semi finished code in material type 2000 . . . For any code processing , below process/steps involved. . . 1) Request for any new tool code by concern department to PPC team through code opening form. . 2) PPC team initiate new Code through MDO on the basis of request received. . 3) After that same code request will reflect in MDO for approval from commercial person. . 4) After approval the code will integrate in SAP and will be available for further processing. . . . . . . . . . . . . Author Amit Katiyar .  . . . . . . . . Bom Creation - .                         The Bom of tool shall be processed only for inhouse produced tools (i.e. the lo-. cations having tool room) . The bom is created when the tool get ready for T0  trials. Ist UT (under test-. ing ) bom created then after successful trial final tool bom created . The t-code used in creation of Bom . is ZCC01 and CS01 and for approval CC02 .  . . Below steps are involved for bom creation : . 1.  Request of bom creation from the concern department will be raised through bom creation form . duly signed by production head , plant head and commercial head . . 2.  The bom request form along with scan copy of form is forwarded to PPC deptt. For processing the . bom in SAP. . 3.  PPC person use t-code ZCC01 to create change no. and then create bom through t-code CS01 in . SAP. . 4.  PPC person forward the request to CRI (to concern person in case of tool) along with scan copy to . approve change number. . 5.  After approval from CRI (t-code CC02) the bom approved in SAP . . . . . . . . Author Amit Katiyar .  . . . Routing & Production Version Creation - .                                                                 . The overall over-head cost/input provided by tool room . Based on input PPC person create routing . using t-code CA01 after approval of bom in SAP .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . After creation of routing PPC person create production version using t-code C223. . . . . . . . . . . . Author Amit Katiyar .  . .

The PPC person forward request to costing person for costing run & release of tool after creation of . bom , routing and production version. . . Costing person check the pre-requisites and run the costing of tool code using t-code CK11N . . . . . . . . . . . . . . After costing run , costing person analyse the cost and if error not occurs then the costing is released . using t-code CK24 .  . . . . . . . . . . . Author Amit Katiyar .  . . Goods Receipt of Tools - .                                       The goods receipt (GR) of tools done by two means . In-house pro-. duced tools are credited/received by production entry and bought out tools are received by GR against . purchase order .  . . a)  Production Entry - .                                            The inhouse tools after it inception is credited/received by production entry . in SAP . User create production order of tool using t-code ZCO01 and confirmed using t-code  . ZCO11N. . . b)  Goods Entry in Store- .                                                         The tool received in stores against purchase order using t-code MIGO . . . . . . . . . . Author Amit Katiyar .  . . Capitalization of Tools- .                                     The tools which are intended to use inhouse i.e. self are capitalize . after credit of inventory either through production entry or through goods receipt (MIGO) . The pro-. cess is as under - .  . a)  For inhouse tool -  .                                                The asset code of the respective tool code is generated by commercial . person . After receipt of installation report of tool order is generated for self consumption after approv-. al of BU and BU-CFO . A self consumption invoice raised against the order and the inventory debited . from FG location. Using t-code MR21 from HO-accounts the cost of FG code of tool (which was re-. leased through costing run) made to zero and the inventory of tool code is generated with zero value. . . b) For Bought out tool - .                                                The asset code of the respective tool code is generated by commercial . person after receipt of installation report for all bought out tools . The tool then capitalize by commer-. cial person. Using t-code MR21 from HO-accounts the cost of FG code of tool (which was released . through costing run) made to zero and the inventory of tool code is generated with zero value. . . . Incase inhouse tool is made for other plant then after getting inventory at FG location a STO (stock . transfer order) is generated by the consignee plant . A invoice raised against the sto and the tool dis-. patched to the respective plant . After receipt of tool at consignee plant the process will be same as for . bought out tool .   . . . . . .
